Things to add/do:
	1. people can only message groups they are in

	2. friendship duplicates (ie username in backwards)
	
	3. Add emails to profile
		Current state: allows for null in table, fix once we generate email data
	
	4. Add group limits to groups

	5. for any getID, prompt before
	
	6. Break confirmFriendships into smaller methods (Maya)
	
	7. Prompt instead of passing
	
	8. Add to ReadMe that friendShips are shown both ways for simplification purposes
	
	9. Fix current friends Table to show the friendships of all going to opposite way
